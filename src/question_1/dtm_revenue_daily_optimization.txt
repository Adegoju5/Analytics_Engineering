Using Incremental Materialization:

If the data in the orders table is frequently updated or new records are added frequently,
you can use incremental materialization in DBT.
Set the materialized parameter to "incremental" in the revenue_daily model.

With this approach, DBT will handle the materialization and maintenance of the revenue_daily model for you,
making it easier to manage the data and improving the charts' loading time.
